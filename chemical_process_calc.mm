The concerned calculations can be classified into three types:&#xa;1. Given the information about input and process, estimate that of the output&#xa;2. Given the information about output and process, estimate that of the input&#xa;3.

<node TEXT="Since the course does not consider nuclear reactions, the total mass of all the constituents of the process is conserved. Further, we assume that the constituents of the equipment do not change with time and therefore, the mass conservation applies to the chemicals that are being processed. Overall, the matter being processed can be classified into the following categories:&#xa;input: The mass of matter that enters into the process&#xa;output: The mass of matter the exits through the process&#xa;generation: The mass of matter that is generated during the process&#xa;consumption: The mass of matter that is consumed during the process&#xa;accumulation: The mass of matter that builds up during the process. Think of it as the net matter that is generated but does not come out of the process.&#xa;Then, input + generation - output - consumption = accumulation   (1.2.3)&#xa;&#xa; We will employ two types of balances in this course, depending on the duration of the process that is considered:&#xa;1. Differential balance: When duration is infinitesimally small. That is, the balance is written for a particular instant during the process. Here, each term in the above equation is a flow rate.This will be generally used for continuous and semi-batch processes.&#xa;2. Integral balance: When the balance is written for an interval between two times. Here, each term represents the amount of matter corresponding to a particular interval. This will be mainly used for the batch process, where the duration will be that of the complete process. &#xa;&#xa;For the steady-state processes, accumulation = 0. Also, following from the conservation of matter, we can see that all steady-state processes are continuous processes. The un-steady state processes can be batch, semi-batch or continuous."

For example, the parameters of the Antoine equation for water.&#xa;&#xa;Following are the important considerations while using a database:&#xa;1) If multiple properties are used from the same database, it is important that the database is &quot;internally consistent.&quot; That is, different properties should satisfy the established thermodynamic relationships. For example, the relationship between Gibbs free energy, entropy and enthalpy. Well known databases have this property and therefore, we may not need to check for consistency during each application.&#xa;&#xa;2) When using the fitted parameters, it is important to consider the range of conditions (temperature, pressure et cetera) over which they are valid.&#xa;&#xa;3) The uncertainties associated with the properties are important.

<node TEXT="The properties of substances can be accessed via numerous websites. However, it is important to select the websites that are managed by professional institutions and which provide details about their sources. One should avoild blindly trusting the results of the popular search engines.&#xa;&#xa;1. NIST chemistry webbook (http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/): This website was launched in 1996 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST is the part of the United States Department of Commerce, and is a non-regulatory agency that provides measurement-standards to the academia and industry. The chemistry webbook contains the physical properties of more than 7000 organic and inorganic compounds. The properties include densities, vapor pressures, enthalpies of fusion/vaporization, solubilities, different spectra, et cetera. The interface is easy to use and available for free. It also provides an extensive list of publications concerned with the data.&#xa;&#xa;2. IUPAC-NIST solubility Database (http://srdata.nist.gov/solubility/index.aspx):    Has its roots in the IUPAC solubility data series that was launched in mid-1970s. It is regularly updated and the data is evaluated by experts. The collaboration between NIST and IUPAC starting from 1998, led to the above mentioned website. It provides the solubilities and liquid-liquid equilibrium data for binary, ternary and quaternary systems. Though mostly focussed on the liquid-liquid systems, it also has data on few solid-liquid systems.&#xa;&#xa;2. Dortmund Data Bank (http://www.ddbst.de/ddb.html): It is a database created by a private company and was started in 1973 by the faculty at the University of Dortmund. It is foucussed on the Chemical Engineering practice and is regularly updated. The free online website provides the properties that are compiled from the publications, wehereas a paid version lets user access the properties that are obtained from the in-house measurements. In addition to pure substances, it also provides properties of certain mixtures.

For example, the dimensions of the connecting pipes will depend on the volumetric flow rate. The above relationships may be based on well-tested theories or they may be semi-empirical. Generally, the later is the case in real industrial scenarios. In this lecture we will focus on the estimation of densities for a pure phase.

<node TEXT="We first discuss the dependence of density on temperature and pressure. It is generally assumed that &quot;pure&quot; solids and liquids are incompressible and therefore, their densities are almost independent of pressure. The temperature dependence can be determined using following approaches:&#xa;&#xa;1) If the system is away from the critical or triple points, one may safely assume that the density of liquid or solid is almost independent of temperature. This will usually be the case for solids.&#xa;&#xa;2)  If the system is near the critical point and is in equilibrium with vapor, one can use the corresponding state theories. These theories have a physical foundation and specify the relationship between the reduced densities of liquids and the reduced temperature, which is same for a broad class of fluids. A reduced density at a particular temperature is the ratio of the density at that temperature to the critical density. Note that the prior knowledge about the critical point is necessary. Interested readers can refer this paper: http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/13/7/10.1063/1.1724033&#xa;&#xa;3) The relationship between reduced liquid densities and reduced temperatures are also used to estimate liquid densities at temperatures away from the critical point and off-coexistence. Most of these relationships are empirical and involve a parameter that is selected to approximately reproduce the densities of a particular class of liquids. One such equation is by Rackett (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/je60047a012).&#xa;&#xa;4) Several other empirical equations have been proposed to estimate the liquid densities from the pressure and temperature. Some of these, like multiparameter equations of state are extensively used due to their inclusion in various software. They are also used to estimate the properties of mixtures. In this course we will not use these equations for the manual calculations (assignments or exams). We will come to them while discussing the software tools for chemical process calculations."

<node TEXT="The simplest equation of state is the ideal gas equation (PV=nRT). It assumes that the molecules of a gas occupy negligible volume and do not interact with each other. It is applicable to gases at low presures and high temperatures. A rule of thumb for using it is as follows (Felder and Rousseau):&#xa;1) For diatomic gases, when RT/P &gt; 0.005 m^3/mol &#xa; 2) For other gases, when RT/P &gt; 0.02 m^3/mol&#xa;&#xa;The assumption of ideal gas will be sometimes implied in the problem statement by mentioning the volumetric flowrate in &quot;standard cubic meters per second (or per hour).&quot; It may be abbreviated as SCMS or SCMH. The term standard in the SI system will imply that the flow rate is provided at the temperature of 273K and the pressure of 10^5 Pa. The ideal gas equation can be then used to calculate the molar flow rate or to calculate the volumetric flowrate at the desired temperature.&#xa;&#xa;When the mixture of gases is assumed to be ideal, one may use the ideal gas equation for individual components. This is done via the concept of partial pressure OR the concept of pure component volume. For example, the problem statement may specify the partial pressure and one needs to estimate the number of moles of the component. Then the ideal gas equation is employed with total volume of the gas. On the other hand, if the problem statement mentions the pure component volume, then one should use the total pressure of the system. Note that the volume fraction of a component is same as molar fraction in an ideal gas mixture." ID="ID_1794321396" CREATED="1465980145291" MODIFIED="1465982969436" NUMBERED="true"/>
<node TEXT="Following are some important types of equations of state for non-ideal gases:&#xa;&#xa;1. Virial equations of state: These equations express the compressibility factor of a gas (PV/nRT) as a polynomial in molar density (see equation (a) below). The form of this expression can be rigorously derived from the statistical mechanics and theoretical approaches are indeed employed to calculate the &quot;virial coefficients&quot; from the molecular-level details. However, the coefficients that are used in most industrial calculations are empirical. The expression is truncated at the second virial coefficient as shown in (b). This is then estimated from an empirical function of reduced temperature. The virial coefficient is fitted to a function of reduced temperature (T/Tc) using a parameter called the accentric factor.&#xa;&#xa;2. Cubic equations of state: These are semi-empirical equations that are so called because they can be expressed as a cubic polynomial in volume. The earliest equation in this category was the Van der Waals equation. However, it is no longer used in real-world applications. The modern equations like Peng-Robinson, and Soave-Redlich-Kwong are known to perform much better and are also implemented in the software tools. The parameters of these equations are based on the critical properties of the fluid.&#xa;&#xa;3. Corresponding state theories and derivatives: As described for liquid densities, they are only suitable for estimating the densities of pure gases that are in equilibrium with liquids. However, there are modifications like the compressibility based equations of state. Here, the empirical data of the compressibility vs reduced pressure (P/Pc) at different reduced temperatures (T/Tc) is used. &#xa;&#xa;4. Multiparameter equations of state. They are similar to the ones described for liquid. We will encounter them again while discussing the software tools for chemical process calculations.&#xa;&#xa;For the manual calculations to be performed during this course, we will mainly use the Peng-Robinson (PR) or Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations of state."

Each phase will have a small proportion of the other component too. The composition of two phases will depend on the solubility of each component in other.

The objective of processes like extraction is to preferrably transfer this third component from one liquid phase to another.&#xa;&#xa;The important term here is the diistribution coefficient (or partition coefficient).

<node TEXT="In this course we will use SI (International system of units). That is, the quantities provided in other systems will be converted into those of SI. This is to ensure the consistency of units across a large calculation involving several different processes. The SI has seven base units: 1) meter (m), 2) kilogram (kg), 3) second (s),  4) kelvin (K), 5) mole (mol), 6) ampere (A) and 7) candela (cd). The course will predominantly use the first five.&#xa;&#xa;A unit from other system can be converted into SI by using the corresponding conversion factor (cf). It specifies the &quot;ratio of SI unit to that in other system&quot;. Example, 0.01 m/cm or 0.001 kg/g. In order to express a quantity in SI units, multiply that with the appropriate conversion factor. They are provided in the Perry&apos;s Chemical Engineer&apos;s handbook.&#xa;&#xa;Additional care is required when handling the conversions involving the temperature. Here, it is important to distinguish between a &quot;temperature&quot; and a &quot;temperature interval&quot;. Let us first consider the case of temperature. Here, the conversion of one unit to another is of the form y = ax+b, where y and x are the temperatures expressed in different units. For example, y may be in Celcius scale and x may be in Fahrenheit scale. For the &quot;tempertaure interval,&quot; the conversion factors between any two scales can be expressed as ratios. If Delta_y and Delta_x represent the temperature intervals corresponding to y and x, respectively, then Delta_y = a Delta_x.&#xa;&#xa;It is sometimes necessary to transform expressions so that the variables are in SI units. In such cases the unit of the quantity is provided in the brackets adjacent to the variables. For example, when discussing flow rates, it is convenient to use the units of time (min or hr) as provided in the problem statement."

<node TEXT="The calculations will be performed using the scientific notation. This helps in keeping track of significant figures. However, the result of the calculation can be converted to a general notation for the ease of oral communication. Significant figures are the digits starting from the first non-zero digit of a number to the 1) last nonzero digit if decimal point is absent or 2) the last digit if the decimal point is present.  The number of significant figures denotes the maximum uncertainty that is expected in a particular value. For example, if mass is provided as 2.00 kg, then there are three significant figures and the maximum uncertainty in this mass is 0.005 kg. Note that 2.00 kg is not the actual average of multiple measurements, but an estimate. However, in some cases the actual average and uncertainty may be provided as 2.001(2) kg. Here, 2.001 kg is the average of multiple measurements and the number in brackets denotes the &quot;measured&quot; uncertainty in the last digit. That is, 2.001 +/- 0.002 kg.&#xa;&#xa;During the multiplication or division involving two numbers with different number of significant figures, the number of significant figures of the result will be same as that of the lowest of the multiplicands or divisors.&#xa;&#xa;During the addition or subtraction of numbers, one should check the position of the last significant digit of each number with respect to the decimal point and identify the number whose last significant digit is farthest to the left.

<node TEXT="It is important to validate the results of the calculations. One can develop her own method for validation. Following are some common techniques:&#xa;&#xa;1) Check if the calculated results are reasonable. For example, densities  cannot have negative values or the liquid density cannot be greater than the vapor density. With real-world problems, this point can be more subtle and this is where experience plays an important role.&#xa;&#xa;2)Back-substitution: If the calculations involve the solution of equations, back-substitute the calculated value in them and check if the &quot;right-hand-side&quot; is equal to the &quot;left-hand-side&quot;.&#xa;&#xa;3) Order-of-magnitude estimation: In some calculations it is possible to estimate the order of magnitude of the final results by approximating the values of different quantities used in the calculation. For example, an equation with coefficients having many significant figures can be approximated with the one having integers. This will help us identify if the actual calculations are on the right track." ID="ID_1548838955" CREATED="1465197805738" MODIFIED="1465199112439" NUMBERED="true"/>

<node TEXT="The number of independent equations should be same as the number of unknown variables in the problem. Due to the conservation of mass, for non-reactive processes, the number of independent equations is same as the number of different chemical components in the input or output of the process. When table-convention as described in notes_1.2.4.pdf is used for each process, then each row (except those describing temperature/pressure) corresponds to a mass balance equation. Therefore, if there are N rows, then there are N - 1 mass balance equations. Additional equations will result from the other information provided in the problem statement. If the number of unknown variables is greater than the total number of independent equations, then following are the possibilities&#xa;&#xa;1) A basis of calculation needs to be assumed. The solution to the problem statement does not depend on this quantity.&#xa;&#xa;2) There are more processes&#xa;&#xa;3) Missing information&#xa;&#xa;On the other hand if the number of unknown variables is less than the number of independent equations, then the problem is &quot;overspecified.&quot; This may be the case when one is expected to validate a solution.&#xa;&#xa;While handling any problem, the initial focus should be on reducing the number of unknown variables using the details provided in the problem statement.

<node TEXT="We will discuss here the strategy to be used for the mass balance of multiple non-reactive processes. The advantages of our nomenclature will be realized in these calculations. The steps to be followed are as follows:&#xa;&#xa;1. Identify different streams and processes and name them according to our convention. Let the nunber of processes be Np and the number of chemical components be Nc. Notice that the total number of &quot;possible&quot; material balances will be Nc*Np*(Np+1)/2. This includes even the combinations of one or more processes. The number of &quot;independent&quot; material balance equations will be Nc*Np. (CAUTION: The above formulae assume that Nc components are present in each process. If the no. of components is different for each process, then the no. of independent balances will be the summaton as shown in equation 1 below. Also, one should be careful that a particular balance for the component is only counted once. This is especially important when a component only appears in the recycle stream.)&#xa;&#xa;2. Tabulate the data with columns as streams and rows as total mass and the fractions of different components. For each process, use the following order: 1) Input streams, 2) output stream without any following process (eg. A5 or D9) and 3) output stream followed by a process (eg. A6B or D10E) and name all the unknown variables like n1,n2 .&#xa;&#xa;4. Check the degrees of freedom (df) for the overall system after considering even the intermediate streams. This will help determine whether the problem can be &quot;completely&quot; solved.&#xa;&#xa;5. First go for the degree of freedom of overall process.&#xa;&#xa;6. Check df for each individual process. Let X be the number of unknown variables in the input and output streams of a process. Let Y be the number of additional relations pertaining to the same process that are provided in the problem statement.For each process the independent material balances will be equal to the number of components(Nc). Then df = X - Y - Nc.&#xa;&#xa;6. If df is large for multiple processes, then determine the combinations of processes for which df is smaller. First, select a process, say P, such that it has least number of unknowns in all the input streams, and the output streams that go out of the system (Those with names of form A[i]P and P[i] where A is the preceding process and i is the integer. Hint: Start with the one with lowest df). This will be the starting process. Let the number of above unknown variables be xp. Then select another process that has least number of unknowns in all the output streams and all the input streams that come from outside the system (Those with names of form [i]Q or Q[i]B, where B is the following process). This will be the end process. Let the number of above unknown variables be xq. Let xi and xo denote the number of unknown variables in the input and output streams (coming into or going out of the combined process P-Q), respectively, for the processes between P and Q. One may now see that the df for the combination of processes starting from P and ending at Q will be xp+xq+xi+xo-Nc. (Is this a NP or P problem?)&#xa;&#xa;7. Use the material balance equations for the Np processes with least number of degrees of freedom. Note that this may also include the combined processes.&#xa;&#xa;The above strategy is depicted using a generic system containing three interconnected processes in notes_2.4.1.pdf. In these notes, the point no. 6 above is not required. We will demonstrate it while solving the specific problem." ID="ID_505794244" CREATED="1466081333233" MODIFIED="1474038067865" NUMBERED="true">
